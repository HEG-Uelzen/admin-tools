# find-students

This script check's if the students of the school db are in the given class, and list's them if not so.


## run the script

To run the script you just need python 3 to be installed. To install the required packages(f.e. pandas for the [csv] data handling), run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` in this directory. Then just ensure your data is placed in `class.csv` and `school.csv`; then run 
```sh
python3 main.py
```
to execute the script.
